# Heart_Failure_FP
Final Project using Heart Failure Dataset from UCI.
The Heart_Failure_DatasetPy notebook contains beautiful visualizations of variables as well as machine learning models 
using decision trees, random forest, and feature importance in Python. 
The HrtFl_StepRg_ChiSq_R notebook contains the stepwise regression and chi square analysis in R. 
Logistic regression in R can be viewed in the HrtFail_LogReg_R notebook.
Hope you enjoy!
